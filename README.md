# Example-Work
This work was made during my IDEA9105 Interface Design course at the University of Sydney. The project was to design interface for a job
seeking platform. As a team, we needed to develop 3 interface for iOS, Android and Web. As for me, I was responsible to develop web interface.
The name of this project is called 'Sydney Casusal'. Which this provide international students a platform to find the available jobs around 
them. Also they could use 'match' function to easily connect with employers and employees.
